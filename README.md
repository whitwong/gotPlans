# Got Plans
Team project to build a food application that returns recipes and restaurant suggestions for users. The application has logic to choose a dine-in or dine-out suggestion for the indecisive user. The application makes AJAX requests to the Zomato API to return restaurant results and to the Yummly API to return recipe results. Features include user authentication with Firebase to allow users to access stored favorite recipes and restaurants for later site visits.

**Technology used:** AJAX, API, Firebase, Media Queries, jQuery, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
